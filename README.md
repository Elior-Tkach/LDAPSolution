# LDAPSolution

## Overview

LDAPSolution is a comprehensive .NET Framework4.8 solution for managing user and group permissions on devices using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). The solution is designed to streamline both the setup and authentication processes for users and groups, and consists of two main components:

###1. LDAP_DLL
A class library (DLL) that encapsulates all the core logic for interacting with an LDAP server. It provides functions to:
- Query users and groups in LDAP.
- Authenticate users against the LDAP server.
- Manage permissions by reading from and writing to a local `LDAP.ini` file, which stores user/group access levels (Admin/Operator).
- Log all operations and errors using NLog for traceability and troubleshooting.

###2. Setup_Application
A user-friendly WPF desktop application that leverages the DLL to provide a graphical interface for administrators. With this application, you can:
- Connect to an LDAP server by specifying its IP address or host name.
- Search for users and groups and view their details.
- Assign or modify permissions for users and groups, which are persisted in the `LDAP.ini` file.
- View, add, or remove permissions, and see a hierarchical view of groups and their members.
- All changes and actions are logged for auditing purposes.

The solution is designed for easy deployment: simply place the required DLLs, the application executable, and the NLog configuration in the same directory. The `LDAP.ini` and log files are generated automatically as you use the application.

## Features

- Assign permissions (Admin/Operator) to users and groups.
- Authenticate users using LDAP.
- All configuration is stored in `LDAP.ini`.
- Logging is handled via NLog.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework4.8
- Access to an LDAP server (provide server IP or host name at runtime)

## Getting Started

1. **Required Files** 
 To run the application, ensure the following files are in the same directory:
 - `LDAP_DLL.dll` (the compiled DLL)
 - `Setup_Application.exe` (the WPF application executable)
 - `NLog.dll` (NLog library)
 - `NLog.config` (NLog configuration file)

2. **First Run** 
 - The application will prompt for the LDAP server's IP or host name.
 - The `LDAP.ini` file will be created automatically as you use the application.
 - Log files will be generated by NLog during operation.

3. **Usage** 
 - Use the WPF interface to add users/groups, assign permissions, and manage authentication.
 - All changes are reflected in the `LDAP.ini` file.

## Project Structure

- `LDAP_DLL`: Contains core LDAP functions, setup and authentication logic.
- `Setup_Application`: WPF UI for setup and management.
- `Test_Authentication`: (Optional) Project for testing authentication features.

## Logging

- Logging is handled by NLog.
- Configure logging behavior in `NLog.config`.
- Log files are created automatically during use.
